Git branching is a feature that allows you to diverge from the main line of development and continue working on different features or fixes 
without affecting the main codebase.
Branching essentially creates a separate line of development within a repository, enabling multiple developers to work on different features 
simultaneously or to experiment with new ideas without disrupting the stable codebase.
